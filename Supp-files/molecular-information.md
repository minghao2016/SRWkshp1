## Molecular/Chemical information 

To generate molecular descriptors, we need information about the molecules. The information could be in any of the following formats:
a) string of characters (with no spaces) like SMILES, b) SDF formatted file c) 3D mol2/sd/PDB file. For this exercise, we will use SMILES strings as molecular representations. 

Please click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system) to read about SMILES,

You can also use pdb, SDF, mol2, and other formats to represent molecules but I will not discuss them in this workshop. Please visit the following link for information on these chemical formats, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_file_format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_file_format)
