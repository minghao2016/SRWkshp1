## Getting ready with rdkit/mordred/Other-libraries using Anaconda

Based on our experience, on a high-speed internet connection, the setting up of environments with the above mentioned libraries will 
take anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes. 

Please note the attendees will work on a cloud instance for this workshop and wont be needing any 
local python/library installations. If the workshop attendees want to use the local software (anaconda/Jupyter/other python libraries mentioned above) installed on their laptop (or desktop), then we recommend the attendees to complete/test the software/library installations ahead of time.
